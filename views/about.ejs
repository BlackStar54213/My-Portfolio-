                        <h2>Turning Ideas Into Scalable, User-Centric Web Solutions</h2>

                        <p> I believe great development goes beyond writing code — it's about building functional,
                            efficient, and enjoyable user
                            experiences. Every project is an opportunity to solve real problems through clean
                            architecture and thoughtful
                            design. <br /><br /> I've worked with a range of teams, from startups to growing businesses,
                            to bring their digital
                            ideas to life. My approach is collaborative and focused on delivering solutions that are
                            maintainable, scalable, and
                            aligned with client goals. <br /><br /> Whether you need a full-stack web application, an
                            intuitive user dashboard,
                            or backend systems that scale, I'm ready to help. I take pride in clean code, attention to
                            detail, and delivering on
                            time. <br /><br /> Feel free to explore my work, and if it aligns with what you're looking
                            for — let’s build
                            something awesome together! </p>

                            <h2>My <span class="z">Journey</span></h2>
                            <p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how websites work behind the
                                scenes. I started by learning
                                the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through self-study and online courses,
                                gradually diving deeper into the
                                world of backend development with Node.js and Express. As my understanding grew, I began
                                applying what I learned by
                                building personal projects and experimenting with full-stack workflows.
                                <br><br>
                                Soon after, I took up a role as a Web Development Instructor at Interkel Nig., where I
                                created and taught a custom
                                syllabus designed to give beginners a strong foundation in both frontend and backend
                                development. This experience
                                sharpened not only my technical skills but also my ability to explain complex concepts
                                simply and effectively.
                                <br><br>
                                I went on to work with Zee Designs as a Full Stack Developer, helping them build their
                                company website based on provided
                                designs using EJS, Express, MongoDB, and Git for version control. This role helped
                                solidify
                                my skills in templating,
                                server-side logic, and working with databases in a production environment.
                                <br><br>
                                Later, I joined a team as a Frontend Developer, collaborating with other developers to
                                build
                                out a client-facing
                                website. I specifically handled the user dashboards, using React, TypeScript, Tailwind
                                CSS,
                                and Git to ensure efficient
                                and scalable UI components.
                                <br><br>
                                Since then I have worked on various Projects, but most recently, I completed an
                                E-commerce project for Adric Phone Stores as a Full Stack
                                Developer,
                                where I built the entire web solution from scratch using the MERN stack. I utilized
                                MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for backend development, and
                                React for the frontend. The project included features such as user authentication,
                                product management, an inventory system, alert system for order notification, an
                                integrated flutterwave payment portal and a responsive design to ensure a seamless user
                                experience across devices. I also implemented RESTful APIs for efficient communication
                                between the frontend and backend.

                                <br><br>
                                I’m passionate about creating user-centric web applications that are not only functional
                                but
                                also attractive.
                                Through every role and project, I’ve developed a strong understanding of both the
                                frontend
                                and backend, with a focus on
                                building functional, user-friendly web applications. I’m always looking to grow,
                                collaborate, and contribute to
                                meaningful work that bridges great design with solid engineering.
